StaffPlan is a management tool to record and assign employee workweek hours and assignments based on specific projects and clients. It allows managers to delegate assignments, keep track of and plan employee's hours, and decipher when an employee is available to take on new tasks. Also, this application allows employees to be aware of who is working on what projects and assignments in the team, to form a more structured and organized work environment.
